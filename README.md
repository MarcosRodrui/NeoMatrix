# Neomatrix

The only purpose of Neomatrix is to recreate the effect that is displayed in "The Matrix" starting sequence with a few additions like a **terminal interface**. It has been created with the idea of allowing maximum customization, that's when the interface comes in handy.

This program only runs on Linux and it was created using C++ with the ncurses library.

## Installation
- Clone the repository and build neomatrix
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/MarcosRodrui/Neomatrix
make
```
## Dependencies
In order to build neomatrix g++ compiler is needed, as well as, ncurses library. Getting the ncurses library should be easy, but that's how you would do it in different Distros:
### Ubuntu / Debian
``` sh
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```
### Arch Linux
``` sh
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```
### Fedora
``` sh
sudo dnf install ncurses-devel
```
## Credits
This was created as a one-person project. The main purpose of this project was to finish a small project using C++. I'm not an expert in this language, but I tried to make the program as less resource consuming as possible. I know it can be done better, but I did my best. Enjoy it :D

Anyone can collaborate on this project, or use the source code as they wish; crediting the original source would be appreciated it.
